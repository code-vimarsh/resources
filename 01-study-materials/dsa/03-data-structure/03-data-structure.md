# Data Structures

This directory covers various data structures commonly used in algorithms and programming.

## Fundamental Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Ordered collections of elements with fixed size.
- **Linked Lists**: Linear data structures with nodes connected by pointers.
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure.
- **Queues**: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure.

## Advanced Data Structures

- **Trees**: Hierarchical data structures with nodes connected by parent-child relationships.
- **Graphs**: Non-linear data structures representing relationships between objects.
- **Heaps**: Special binary trees that maintain a specific order among nodes.
- **Hash Tables**: Data structures that use a hash function to map keys to values.

## Importance

Data structures provide efficient ways to store, organize, and retrieve data. The choice of data structure significantly impacts the performance of algorithms.
