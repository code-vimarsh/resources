# Backtracking

This directory explores backtracking, a general algorithmic technique for solving problems by systematically trying all possible solutions.

## Definition

- **Backtracking**: A systematic approach to find solutions by exploring a search tree.
- **Branching**: Exploring different possibilities at each step.
- **Backtracking**: Reversing steps if a path leads to a dead end.

## Examples

- **Sudoku Solver**: Solving Sudoku puzzles.
- **N-Queens Problem**: Placing N queens on an N x N chessboard without attacking each other.
- **Knapsack Problem**: Finding the optimal combination of items to fill a knapsack with maximum value.

## Steps

1. **Start at the root of the search tree.**
2. **Explore each branch until a solution is found or a dead end is reached.**
3. **If a dead end is encountered, backtrack to the previous decision point and try a different branch.**

## Advantages

- **Finds all possible solutions.**
- **Can be used for a wide range of problems.**

## Disadvantages

- **Can be computationally expensive for large search spaces.**
- **Requires careful design and implementation.**
