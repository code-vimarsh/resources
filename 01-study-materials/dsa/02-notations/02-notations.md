# Asymptotic Notations for Algorithm Analysis

This directory explores the different asymptotic notations used to describe the growth rate of algorithms.

## Big O Notation (O)

- **Upper bound**: Represents the worst-case scenario.
- Describes the maximum rate of growth.
- Example: O(n^2) means the algorithm's running time grows no faster than n^2.

## Omega Notation (Ω)

- **Lower bound**: Represents the best-case scenario.
- Describes the minimum rate of growth.
- Example: Ω(n) means the algorithm's running time grows at least as fast as n.

## Theta Notation (Θ)

- **Tight bound**: Describes both the upper and lower bounds.
- Represents the exact rate of growth.
- Example: Θ(n) means the algorithm's running time grows directly proportional to n.

## Importance

Asymptotic notations allow us to compare algorithms based on their growth rates, regardless of specific machine or implementation details.
