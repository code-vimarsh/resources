# Recursion

This directory delves into the concept of recursion, a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself.

## Definition

- **Recursion**: A function calling itself within its own definition.
- **Base Case**: A condition that stops the recursion from running infinitely.
- **Recursive Step**: The function call to itself.

## Examples

- **Factorial**: Calculating the factorial of a number.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Generating the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Tower of Hanoi**: Solving the classic puzzle.

## Advantages

- **Elegance**: Can express complex problems concisely.
- **Simplicity**: Can break down problems into smaller, similar subproblems.
- **Readability**: Can often make code easier to understand.

## Disadvantages

- **Performance**: Can be inefficient for large inputs.
- **Stack Overflow**: Potential for stack overflow errors if not handled carefully.
- **Debugging**: Can be challenging to debug recursive functions.
