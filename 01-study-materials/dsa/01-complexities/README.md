# Time and Space Complexity in Algorithms

This directory explains the fundamental concepts of time and space complexity used to analyze algorithm efficiency.

## Time Complexity

- Measures how the running time of an algorithm scales with the input size.
- Expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n), O(n^2), O(log n)).
- **Examples**:
   - **O(n)**: Linear time (e.g., searching an array).
   - **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time (e.g., nested loops iterating over an array).
   - **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time (e.g., binary search).

## Space Complexity

- Measures how much memory an algorithm uses as a function of input size.
- Also expressed using Big O notation.
- **Examples**:
   - **O(1)**: Constant space (e.g., swapping two variables).
   - **O(n)**: Linear space (e.g., storing an array).

## Importance

Understanding time and space complexity is crucial for:
- Choosing the most efficient algorithm for a given task.
- Optimizing existing code to improve performance.
- Evaluating the scalability of algorithms.
