# Dynamic Programming

This directory explores dynamic programming, an optimization technique for solving problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems.

## Definition

- **Dynamic Programming**: A technique for solving complex problems by storing solutions to subproblems and reusing them later.
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: Solutions to smaller subproblems are used multiple times.
- **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to subproblems.

## Examples

- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Calculating the nth Fibonacci number efficiently.
- **Longest Common Subsequence**: Finding the longest common subsequence between two strings.
- **Coin Change**: Finding the minimum number of coins to make change for a given amount.

## Techniques

- **Top-Down (Memoization):** Recursively solve subproblems and store their solutions in a table.
- **Bottom-Up (Tabulation):** Build a table of solutions to subproblems iteratively.

## Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Can significantly reduce time complexity compared to brute-force methods.
- **Clear Solutions**: Provides structured and clear solutions.
- **Wide Applicability**: Applicable to various optimization problems.
