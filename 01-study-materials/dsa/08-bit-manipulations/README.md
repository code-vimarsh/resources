# Bit Manipulation

This directory delves into bit manipulation techniques, which involve working directly with the binary representation of data.

## Why Bit Manipulation?

- **Efficiency**: Can be faster than traditional arithmetic operations.
- **Compact Representation**: Can save memory by representing data in binary format.
- **Low-Level Control**: Allows for precise control over data at the bit level.

## Basic Operations

- **AND (&)**
- **OR (|)**
- **XOR (^)**
- **NOT (~)**
- **Left Shift (<<)**
- **Right Shift (>>)**

## Examples

- **Setting a Bit**: Setting a specific bit to 1.
- **Clearing a Bit**: Setting a specific bit to 0.
- **Flipping a Bit**: Toggling a bit between 0 and 1.
- **Checking a Bit**: Checking if a specific bit is set.
- **Swapping Two Numbers**: Swapping two numbers using bitwise operations.

## Applications

- **Cryptography**: Used in encryption and decryption algorithms.
- **Data Compression**: Reducing the size of data using bit patterns.
- **Graphics**:  Manipulating colors and images.
- **Network Communication**: Encoding and decoding data in network protocols.
